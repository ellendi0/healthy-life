The idea of the project is that it is a program to control your nutrition, 
which allows you to lose weight, gain weight or simply maintain it. 
After registration, the user must enter his data, such as weight, height, 
age, goal (losing weight, gaining weight, etc.), lifestyle, which will be used in the future. 
The user can add the amount of food he consumes during the day, and based 
on its weight, the calorie content is calculated.

For the development of this project were used Java, Spring and Hibernate.
